1)
Counting Vowels in an Array of Characters
Write a program to count the number of vowels in an array of characters.


public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char[] arr = {'a', 'b', 'e', 'i', 'o'};
        int count = 0;
        
        for (char ch : arr) {
            if ("aeiou".indexOf(ch) != -1) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println("Vowels: " + count);
    }
}



2)
Finding the Most Frequent Element
Write a program to find the most frequent element in a 1D array.

3)
 Finding Maximum Product of Two Integers
Write a program to find the maximum product of two integers in a 1D array.
input :
int[] arr = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};

output :
Maximum Product = 63

4)
Finding the Intersection of Two Arrays
Objective: Write a Java program that finds the intersection of two 1D arrays, which includes the common elements present in both arrays.
input :
int[] arr1 = {1, 2, 2, 1};
int[] arr2 = {2, 2};

output :
Intersection: [2, 2]

5)
Finding All Pairs with a Given Sum
Write a program to find all pairs of integers in an array that sum to a specific target.

Input:

A 1D integer array (e.g., int[] arr = {2, 7, 11, 15, -2, 9};)
A target sum value (e.g., target = 9)
Output:

All pairs of integers that add up to the target sum.

6)
 Checking for Palindrome Array
Write a program to check if the elements of an array form a palindrome.

7)
Matrix Addition
Question: Write a Java program to add two 2D arrays (matrices) of the same dimensions.
Test: Understanding matrix addition.

input :
int[][] matrix1 = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
int[][] matrix2 = {{5, 6}, {7, 8}};

output : 
Sum = {{6, 8}, {10, 12}}

8)
Matrix Multiplication
Question: Write a Java program to multiply two 2D arrays (matrices) where the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second.
Test: Matrix multiplication logic.

input :
int[][] matrix1 = {{1, 2}, {3, 4}};
int[][] matrix2 = {{5, 6}, {7, 8}};

output :
Product = {{19, 22}, {43, 50}}

9)
Matrix Diagonal Sum
Question: Write a Java program to calculate the sum of the diagonal elements of a square matrix.
Test: Iterating through the diagonal elements.

input :
int[][] matrix = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};

output :
Diagonal Sum = 15 (1 + 5 + 9)

10)
Search in 2D Matrix
Question: Write a Java program to search for a specific value in a 2D matrix and return its location.
Test: Searching through a 2D array.

input :
int[][] matrix = {{1, 3, 5}, {7, 9, 11}, {13, 15, 17}};
int target = 9;

output :
Target found at (1, 1)
